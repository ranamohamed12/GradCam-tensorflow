# GradCam-tensorflow
A notebook for implementing Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize the regions of an image that contribute most to the model's predictions. This technique is useful for interpreting deep learning models, especially in image classification tasks.

## Features
- Visualize the important regions in an image for a given class prediction.
- Compatible with Keras models, specifically Xception.
- Easy-to-use functions for loading images, processing them, and generating heatmaps.
- Option to customize heatmap color maps.
